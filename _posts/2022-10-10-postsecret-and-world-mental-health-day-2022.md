I've written about Mental Health a few times, but I want to continue the conversation. I still feel many of us bottle up our emotions, and this can be more dangerous in this post-pandemic world. 

October 10 is World Mental Health Day

Pre-pandemic, we could mask these emotions by going out with friends and having that physical connection with people. Nowadays, we no longer have that presence and support. 

[Watch this video of Paddy Pimblett on Mental Health](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxV_6d4ejVciPwah7MHXlBv_ldxNFuHAgj).

I've already shared a couple of ways I got through my personal battle, but I wanted to share one more thing.

I subscribe to the RSS* feed of [PostSecret](https://postsecret.com). 

**PostSecret** is an ongoing [community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_art "Community art") [mail art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_art "Mail art") project, created by Frank Warren in 2005, in which people mail their secrets anonymously on a homemade postcard. Selected secrets are then posted on the PostSecret website or used for PostSecret's books or museum exhibits.

## I am NOT alone

Yes, we have our friends and family around us, but sometimes, we still feel that they don't understand us, that nobody understands us. Through the secrets shared, I felt that somebody understood how I was feeling and what I was going through.

## I feel grateful

This might be a little bad, but reading these secrets made me more grateful for my life. I see the problems others are going through, and it makes me realize how I take what I have for granted. 

It just gives us a different perspective on our lives. 

## Hotline
