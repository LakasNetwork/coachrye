A few weeks back, during our weekly Casa Salvanera review, Alaine and I looked at past goals and noticed that my passion projects have been stagnant, specifically coaching. 

> Alaine asked the tough question, "What happened to your coaching mojo?"

I'm not going to get into all the things we listed down from <a href="/post/8">my mental health issues</a>, <a href="/post/20">preparing and the aftermath of moving to Canada</a>, and so much more. 

<small>*I'm not saying it's not important to introspect! It is. It's just a long process that deserves it's own post. That'll come soon.*</small>

What I want to share now is the reminder I got to **ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF NUMBER ONE**.

Yup, take care of ourselves first!

## What are you doing to take care of yourself?
