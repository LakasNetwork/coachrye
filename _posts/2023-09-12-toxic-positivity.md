Society often champions positivity as a desirable trait, especially in the pursuit of happiness and self improvement. Many taglines on social media and self-help often go “good vibes only” or “stay positive no matter what.” 

However, while a positive mindset can indeed have its benefits, there exists an opposite side to this pursuit. This is known as [“toxic positivity.”](https://beyondei.inc/can-positivity-be-toxic/) This article explores the concept of toxic positivity, examining its definition and examining its effects on mental health. We also provide insights on how to strike a balance between optimism and authenticity.

# Definition of Toxic Positivity

Toxic positivity can be best described as an overemphasis on maintaining a positive outlook to an unhealthy extent. Staying positive despite very difficult situations is often at the expense of one's true feelings and emotions. 

It's the act of brushing aside or invalidating any negative emotions, experiences, or struggles in favor of an exclusively upbeat facade. While most people mean well, toxic positivity denies people the space to acknowledge, process, and express their genuine emotions. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and emotional suppression.

The phenomenon of toxic positivity often manifests in statements like "just think positive thoughts," "everything happens for a reason," or "don't worry, be happy." Positive taglines can have the intention of boosting your mood, but they might overlook the difficulties that individuals encounter. Toxic positivity can have a negative impact on one's [mental health](https://www.coachrye.com/2022/how-exercise-and-meditation-support-your-mental-health) as it creates an expectation to always be happy and hide any challenging emotions.

# Impact of Toxic Positivity 

The impact of toxic positivity can be far-reaching. It can affect individuals' mental and emotional well-being in various ways. When individuals are pressured to maintain a facade of constant happiness, they may feel isolated and misunderstood. 

Some negative impacts of toxic positivity on an individual include:

## Emotional Suppression

Constantly striving for a positive outlook can lead to the suppression of genuine emotions. People need an outlet for expressing what they feel. If they stay “positive” in the face of very negative situations, it forces individuals to deny or ignore their true feelings.

## Isolation and Misunderstanding

Those practicing toxic positivity might find it difficult to connect authentically with others. This is because they’re not showing what they truly feel. Being honest is key in connecting with your peers. People who are toxic positive may find that friends and loved ones struggle to understand them, leading to a sense of isolation and a lack of empathy.

## Masking Real Issues

Focusing solely on positivity may cause individuals to overlook or downplay real problems in their lives. This can prevent them from seeking appropriate solutions and taking necessary actions. An example of this is someone experiencing a health issue. Despite the seriousness of their issue, they may choose to overlook it or maintain a façade of positivity.

## Unrealistic Expectations

Another consequence of toxic positivity is the development of unrealistic expectations towards life. Since it implies that one should always be happy and upbeat, people may feel like they’re not doing enough if they don’t always stay happy. This can create a sense of inadequacy when individuals inevitably experience negative emotions.

# How to Overcome Toxic Positivity

Overcoming toxic positivity requires finding a balance between embracing optimism and acknowledging the range of human emotions. Here are some ways to achieve this balance:

## Cultivate Emotional Awareness

Begin by recognizing and accepting your emotions, both positive and negative. Allow yourself the space to feel and express what you're truly experiencing without judgment. Don’t push away negativity. Instead, accept them as realistic thinking. 

## Practice Mindfulness

Engage in mindfulness techniques to stay present and attuned to your emotions. You can do this by meditating or simply acknowledging what you feel. Mindfulness encourages nonjudgmental observation. This helps you to detach from toxic positivity's pressure to always be upbeat.

## Encourage Honest Communication

Create a supportive environment where open and honest conversations about emotions are welcomed. Encourage friends, family, and colleagues to share their thoughts without fear of judgment. 

Don’t put them down when they feel negative emotions. Instead, you want to acknowledge what they feel. If they’re open to it, you can also provide each other with healthier ways of coping with their emotions.

## Seek Professional Help

If toxic positivity has taken a toll on your mental health, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional. Therapy can provide a safe space to explore and address the impact of suppressing emotions.

Getting help from a professional can help you understand that life is filled with ups and downs. They will help you process your emotions so that you can navigate through your feelings. .

# Summary

While positivity is essential for living a more fruitful life,  it's essential to recognize the harmful effects of toxic positivity. Suppressing negative emotions and denying the complexities of human experience can lead to various problems.

As such, you must know how to strike a balance between positivity and authenticity. Sometimes, it's okay not to be okay. Acknowledging our vulnerabilities is an essential step towards true emotional health.
