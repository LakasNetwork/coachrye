What does it mean to have a better life? Well, that really depends on your situation. Let's be real and ask ourselves which areas we need to focus on today! Your focus may change next month, next week or even tomorrow... but, today, what do you need to work on?

In today's video, I ask about the different areas that you may want to focus on so you can start living a better life. Did I miss an area that others might need to work on? Let me know.
