Relaunching my channel and this time, I will focus on asking questionsto help people live better lives. 

I'm NOT here to tell people what a better life is
I will NOT force y'all to do anything. 
I'll certainly NOT give any answers and unsolicited advice.

That's not what the channel is about.

Yes, I will share my stories and experiences but, ultimately, you I want to let whoever watches come up with their own path. 

I'm simply going to guide them with questions.

Because in the end, only you have the right answers.
