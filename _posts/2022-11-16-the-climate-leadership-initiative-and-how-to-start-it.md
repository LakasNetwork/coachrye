By now, we all know the debilitating effects of climate change in every aspect of our lives. From the food we serve on our tables to the air we breathe, we, as entrepreneurs and business leaders, can no longer turn a blind eye to the very real environmental and societal issues we face. 

Here’s the good news: [business leaders can foster a culture](https://www.hourly.io/post/why-is-company-culture-so-important) that cares deeply about the planet and everyone in it. We can do this by initiating climate leadership. After all, while individuals can make sustainable changes in their lifestyles, it is companies and corporations that must take the lead. 

Let's take a closer look at what climate leadership entails and how you can implement it within your organization to effect real change.


## What is the Climate Leadership Initiative? 

Nowadays, [corporate sustainability in the new low-carbon era](https://www.sinaitechnologies.com/post/corporate-sustainability-five-trending-best-practices) is not optional; it is an expectation. Businesses are aware of the risks that climate change poses to their operations, supply chains, and the economy at large. However, they are also aware of the new economic opportunities that climate change ushers in, including the chance to develop innovative technology and create more sustainable business models.

All of these possibilities are motivating an increasing number of businesses to set emissions reduction targets, create carbon neutrality plans, and support climate change legislation. 

Regardless of their industry, businesses can be climate leaders by committing to ambitious decarbonization plans and strategies. The great thing about being a climate leader is that you're helping the environment and enjoying a competitive advantage in the upcoming decade at the same time.


## How To Start Climate Leadership

Becoming a climate leader means putting all the [words of encouragement](https://www.coachrye.com/2022/more-than-words-7-impacts-of-positive-words-of-encouragement) you share with your employees, clients, and stakeholders into action. Here are some solutions you can put in place to become a climate leader: 



1. Measure and Analyze Your Portfolio 

The journey toward becoming a climate leader always begins with you having a clear understanding of how your portfolio fits with the societal goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. This means measuring your CO2 emissions. 

There are a lot of carbon footprint-certified private organizations that can do this for you. Once you know your current GHG emissions, the professionals you hire must then analyze them to determine which business operations produce the most pollution. 

After completing this analysis, you can start thinking about ways to lower your emissions.



2. Reduce Energy Consumption or Switch To Renewable 

Sometimes, it’s the simplest actions that make all the difference! Don’t forget to turn off the lights in the office at night, reduce the temperature of the heating or cooling system, and unplug appliances when not in use. 

Paying closer attention to your routine actions can gradually reduce your energy usage.

Alternatively, you can try giving renewable energy a go! Reducing your reliance on fossil fuels will definitely have a drastic impact on your carbon footprint. 



3. Speak With Your Employees, Customers, and Stakeholders 

As economic agents, companies are also responsible for raising awareness among their staff, consumers, and other stakeholders. One way to do this is to host internal competitions, hackathons, or campaigns to increase and improve the public's awareness of sustainability issues. 

You can even join forces with outside organizations and come up with something powerful, original, and memorable.



4. Cut Back on Waste and Combat Obsolescence 

All businesses produce waste, whether it is the industrial waste of a large corporation or the paper waste of an SME. So if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, reduce the amount of waste you generate. 

Start by avoiding disposable cups, stirrers, and capsules for the coffee machine, then work your way up by reducing the number of prints, reusing papers as drafts, and correctly sorting waste for recycling.



5. Go For Eco-Friendly Infrastructure and Equipment 

Why not opt for infrastructure and equipment that are friendlier to the environment? 

When it's time to replace printers, air conditioners, computers, screens, lightbulbs, or other office supplies, choose the most energy-efficient and ethically responsible options. Just make sure you only replace them once they can’t be fixed or you need more. 



6. Encourage Environmentally Friendly Methods of Working 

Some work practices are more environmentally friendly than others. Telecommuting is one such practice. Another option is to use video conferences rather than let employees drive to client appointments.

Avoid copying the entire company in an email that only concerns one department! This might look like a simple act, but you’ll be surprised by the amount of CO2 emissions you’ll save. Remember, because computer work and the Internet use servers, they have strong environmental impacts too. 



7. Support Climate Change Legislation

Caring about the environment is political. Therefore, companies that seek to combat climate change must be aggressive in their territory, at the regional or national level. 

You can have a significant impact by urging prominent figures like politicians to take action against global warming. If your company and others stay active, this can lead to new environmental legislation. 


## Leading The Way To A Better Future 

Climate leadership is so important right here, right now, because these leaders inspire us to fight harder for our only home. So step up and become a climate leader today so that all of us and the generations after us can enjoy a brighter tomorrow.
