And if you don't know where to start digging yourself out of your debts, don't worry because we've got your back. We have a few effective ways to help you pay off your debts and get out of financial ruin. Here are some of them:


## Create a Budget Plan and Follow It.

The first effective way to follow when paying off your debt is to have a budget plan. You wouldn't want to leave your household expenses behind to prioritize your debts more than the essentials. It will cause your downfall.

In light of this, making a budget plan is probably the most crucial action you should take. So, how should you start? First, you must determine how much money is coming in and going out every month. From there, you can proceed with [budgeting your paycheck](https://www2.earnin.com/blog/complete-beginner-guide-budgeting) for your expenses and debts. You can use different software tools and budgeting applications available online to help you.

After you've made a plan, make sure to follow it! Creating a budget plan is useless if you don't stick to it.


## Find Ways To Have Extra Funds for Your Debts. 

If your current income only covers your expenses, you must start thinking of creative ways to get the money you need for your debts. Luckily, we've already done that for you. Here are a few that can help:


## Cut Back on Spending 

To have extra cash allotted for paying debts, you must try to get out of an expensive lifestyle and cut back on spending. Start by lessening or even canceling your lunch outs with friends. Be resourceful. You can use the ingredients stuck in the fridge and make a savory meal out of them. Refrain from buying unnecessary items that you won't use frequently. Lastly, resigning from memberships will also help in this initiative. Doing all these can help you save money to pay your debts.


## Sell Stuff You Do Not Need Anymore

Since we all have unnecessary junk lying around our homes, why not get rid of it while earning some extra cash? This strategy is another effective way to make extra money to pay your debtsâ€”selling some items you don't need anymore. Doing this is a win-win situation because you're not only decluttering your home but also paying off your debt simultaneously.

To start the process, you must first engage in introspection to know the few things you don't truly need. After that, you can start selling these items online or at a garage sale. Whatever you do, make sure that your income in this will be going to your debt payments.


## Get a Side Hustle

If you still have free time on your schedule, use that time for a side hustle. You can get a part-time job or any side hustle you can find to earn more money. Whether it's pet-sitting, tutoring, or visual assistance, as long as you get extra funds, a side hustle can help make a dent in your debts. 


## Set up a Debt Repayment Plan.

Once you establish your budget, you may start planning your debt repayment strategy. If you have multiple debts, you can make a repayment plan to concentrate on paying one at a time. There are two approaches you can follow: snowball and avalanche.

The **debt snowball** is a repayment strategy where you focus on debts of the smallest size. You start with paying your smallest debt and make your way up. This strategy of paying off a small debt may motivate you to keep moving forward with your debt repayment plan. 

Meanwhile, the **debt avalanche** works the other way around. In this strategy, you prioritize paying debt with the highest interest rate. As a result, you pay less interest and have more money available to pay down other debt. It is suitable for people who prioritize saving money on interest as a top priority.


## Consider a Debt Consolidation Loan.

Another effective way to manage multiple debts is to apply for a debt consolidation loan. This is an option if the two repayment strategies don't seem to be feasible. With this approach, the lender settles all of your existing debts and combines them into a single, new loan. It's a good option if you're struggling to pay for each debt you owe. And while the new interest rate may be higher than some of your payments, avoiding late and missed payment fines can help you save money.

To determine if considering debt consolidation is the best option in your situation, you must compute your blended interest rate first. It tackles the total interest rate on all of your debts. Doing this can help you stay on top of your debts.


## Pay More Than The Minimum Balance When You Can. 

Don't give in to the urge to spend any additional money you may have on any other things. Whether you get the fund from your side hustle or windfalls, prioritizing your debts over your wants can help you escape financial ruin. Pay more than the minimum balance instead. An additional amount of money can significantly impact your debt repayment journey.


## Final Words

Paying off your debts is definitely a long and overwhelming process, but the journey is all worthwhile. By following our tips, digging yourself out of debt and achieving financial security is possible.
